            <p class=indextext1><span>I attended Ann Arbor Skyline high school from 2011-2015. Having just opened in 2008, my freshman year was 
                actually the first time the school had all four grades enrolled. My experience overall in high school was 
                an enjoyable one. I made some awesome friends, learned some really cool stuff, and really grew as a person
                (both figuratively and physically). I took french classes for four years, which prepared me well for college
                level language classes. I took several AP classes which were challenging, but overall rewarding. However, my
                fondest memories weren't actually from classes, but was from sports.
            </span></p>

                In all four years of high school, I was on the cross country and track teams. So as you can imagine, I ran a lot. 
                There were times where I thought I would quit, specifically days where we had really intense speed workouts. But most of the time,
                it was a lot of fun! My best friends also did cross country and track, which made it much more bearable. My freshman year, we finished 
                second to last in our region for cross country, which was very disappointing. But, after some development (and effective coaching changes), we turned
                it around and qualified as a team to go to states my senior year, finishing in 13th place. Given where we started off as freshman, this was
                a huge accomplishment and something I will never forget. Thanks to track and cross country, I built strong friendships but also stayed in 
                very good shape.
