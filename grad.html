        After graduating from undergrad with two degrees and a minor, I still decided that that wasn't enough. I also decided that I wasn't done
        with Ann Arbor, or the university for that matter. I started (and now currently) pursuing a master's degree in information at the School of Information, with
        a concentration in user experience (UX). Now when I tell this to people, I usually am hit with two immediate questions: "what do you even learn at the School of
        Information?" and "UX? What is UX?", to which I immediately respond with the simple answers: technology and designing interfaces. Of course, both answers are very
        superficial and not very accurate, but it's a lot easier for my elderly relatives to understand this way.
    </span></p>

        I didn't even know user experience existed as a field until my enrollment here, but I'm so glad I discovered it because now I am obsessed with it. The way I view the world
        and approach problem-solving has changed. My understanding of how people interact with objects is much more in-depth. Thanks to Don Norman, I can never look at a door the same
        way again. Growing up with an iPod touch, I always wondered how they even made apps like Temple Run and Angry Birds. Now, I finally understand. Designing pleasurable 
        experiences has become a passion of mine, and I enjoy keeping up with the latest design trends and tech news. I definitely feel like this degree has (so far) done a great job
        preparing me for getting a high-quality job in the tech world.

        Outside the classroom, the main activity I have participated in is boxing. I tried out for and made the Michigan Boxing Club. Before this year, I have never boxed before, or really
        participated in any contact sport. But, boxing has really helped me improve who I am physically and mentally. I now feel like I have much more control over my body, and I understand 
        what my body's limits are. Being on the team has helped keep me accountable, both on the team but also in other parts of life such as school. I was lucky enough to be able to fight 
        one bout this season last February against a fighter from Iowa State University. Although I did not win the fight, I was very proud of myself for making it through my first fight and 
        I stood my ground well.
