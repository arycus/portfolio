                I attended the University of Michigan for undergrad school, double majoring in economics and statistics. I remember going into my freshman year excited but also
                a little nervous. Being from Ann Arbor made the transition easier, and so did most of my friends also coming to U of M as well. One thing that confused me was that I never actually knew 
                where U of M classes were. In high school I often times walked through campus with my friends, not knowing what went on in each building. I was excited to finally find out. 
            </span></p>
            <p class="utext2" id="ut2"><span>
                By far the hardest challenge for me was deciding on what I was going to major in. My freshman year, I took a wide variety of classes in astronomy, economics, political science, psychology,
                and many others. I actually started off in the Residential College, but then left the program after my first semester. I first decided to major in economics at the end of my sophomore year, not because I was very passionate about it, but because it seemed like a practical degree to get. Next year, after
                taking Stats 250, I realized that I enjoyed what we learned, and ultimately decided to declare a statistics major as well at the end of my junoir year. On top of all this, I also minored in 
                environmental studies. As you can see, it was hard for me to choose one direction to follow.
            </span></p>
            <p class="utext3"><span>
                The next challenge I had was finding activities to participate in outside of the classroom. I first tried out for the Ultimate club freshman year but failed to make the team. I joined a Residential College forum called 
                Diversity Forum, but we met only once a week and I can't say I really made friends from it (nor was it very fun if we're being honest). Eventually, my senior year, I became a board member for the Michigan Undergraduate
                Society for Statistics, where we held networking and social events for other students involved with statistics. Besides all of this, I had a solid friend group, actually the same friend group I had in high school, with whom
                I hung out with a lot. We went to football games together, experienced Rick's and Skeep's for the first times together, and traveled together.
